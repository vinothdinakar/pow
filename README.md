# Proof of Work

Basic example for finding a SHA256 hash and finding a hash with matching pattern

Use `npm install` to install the dependencies

Start the application with 

	node  index.js

User will be asked to type a word.

Node will then calculate the SHA256 hash value of the work.

It will generate a json sample like a block and calculate the SHA256 hash value of the JSON block.

It will then try to generate a hash value of the JSON block matching the pattern based on the difficulty
